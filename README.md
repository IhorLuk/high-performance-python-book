# My working through the book `High Performance Python (2nd Edition)`

`https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-python/9781492055013/`

1. Chapter 1

Testing: - create test/ folder, use pytest library, use coverage tool to progress
Docstrings to every class and function
Keep PEP8 coding standards

2. Chapter 2 - 
Throughout the chapter we work with Julia set - it's a dynamic form of Mandelbrot set, as I understood after a short investigation.
With this algorithm we can test a high computing performance.

- Instead of using lots of print statements to see how the code works, we shoul use decorators - `@` - it's a cleaner approach and could be made to more advanced level
